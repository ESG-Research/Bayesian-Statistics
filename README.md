# Bayesian-Statistics
Bayesian statistics methodology, models and code.
Types of priors: noninformative, computationally convenient (e.g., conjugate), subjective (e.g., skeptical), structured (e.g., shrinkage using Laplace prior from Lesson 9), and hierarchical. Each of these captures in some sense our “prior” beliefs about model parameters.
