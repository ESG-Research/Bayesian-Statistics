# Bayesian-Statistics
Bayesian statistics methodology, models and code.

Skill checklist:

# Bayesian Statistics

1) Interpret and specify the components of Bayesian statistical models: likelihood, prior, posterior.Types of priors: noninformative, computationally convenient     
   (e.g., conjugate), subjective (e.g., skeptical), structured (e.g., shrinkage using Laplace prior), and hierarchical. Each of these captures in some sense our 
   “prior” beliefs about model parameters.

2) Explain the basics of sampling algorithms, including sampling from
   standard distributions and using MCMC to sample from non-standard
   posterior distributions.

3) Assess the performance of a statistical model and compare competing
   models using posterior samples.

4) Coding in R to achieve the above tasks.

# Mixture Models

1) Define mixture model.

2) Explain the likelihood function associated with a random sample
  from a mixture distribution.

3) Derive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for fitting mixture models.

# Time Series Analysis

1) Define time series and stochastic processes (univariate, discrete-
  time, equally-spaced);

2) Define strong and weak stationarity;

3) Define the auto-covariance function, the auto-correlation function
  (ACF), and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF);

4) Definition of the general class of autoregressive processes of order p.
