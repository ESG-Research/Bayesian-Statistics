Bayesian statistics methodology, models and code.
Skill checklist:
Bayesian Statistics
1)Interpret and specify the components of Bayesian statistical models: likelihood, prior, posterior.
  Types of priors: noninformative, computationally convenient (e.g., conjugate), subjective (e.g., skeptical), structured (e.g., shrinkage using Laplace prior), and     hierarchical. Each of these captures in some sense our “prior” beliefs about model parameters.

2)Explain the basics of sampling algorithms, including sampling from
  standard distributions and using MCMC to sample from non-standard
  posterior distributions.

3)Assess the performance of a statistical model and compare competing
  models using posterior samples.

4)Coding in R to achieve the above tasks.
