## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
#Trace plots provide an informal diagnostic for the convergence of our chains. We can back up these visual results with the Gelman and Rubin diagnostic.

#This diagnostic requires that we fit multiple chains. It calculates the variability within chains and compares that to the variability between the chains.
```

```{r}
# First, we need to combine the chains all into one object here with mcmc.list function and we'll start a new script and call the diagnostic. It's part of the coda package, and it's calledd gelman.diag
```

#"Raftery and Lewis diagnostic" can help you decide how many iterations you need to reliably estimate outer quantiles of the target distribution.
```

```{r}
#High autocorrelation leads to low MCMC effective sample size.
