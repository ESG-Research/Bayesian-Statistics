## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Modeling within JAGS
#1.Specify the model.
#2.Set up the model.
#3.Run the MCMC sampler.
#4.Post processing.
```

```{r}
#1.Specify the model.In this step, we give JAGS the hierarchical structure of the model, assigning distributions to the data (the likelihood) and parameters (priors). The syntax for this step is very similar to R, but there are some key differences.

mod_string = " model {
  for (i in 1:n) {
    y[i] ~ dnorm(mu, 1.0/sig2)
  }
  mu ~ dt(0.0, 1.0/1.0, 1.0) # location, inverse scale, degrees of freedom
  sig2 = 1.0
} "

#One of the primary differences between the syntax of JAGS and R is how the distributions are parameterized. 

```

```{r}
#2.Set up the model.
set.seed(50)
y = c(1.2, 1.4, -0.5, 0.3, 0.9, 2.3, 1.0, 0.1, 1.3, 1.9)
n = length(y)

data_jags = list(y=y, n=n)
params = c("mu")

inits = function() {
  inits = list("mu"=0.0)
} # optional (and fixed)There are multiple ways to specify initial values here. They can be explicitly set, as we did here, or they can be random, i.e., list("mu"=rnorm(1)). Also, we can omit the initial values, and JAGS will provide them.

mod = jags.model(textConnection(mod_string), data=data_jags, inits=inits)

```

```{r}
#3.Run the MCMC sampler.
update(mod,500)
mod_sim = coda.samples(model=mod, variable.names = params,n.iter = 1e3)
```

```{r}
#4.Post processing.
library(coda)
plot(mod_sim)
summary(mod_sim)
